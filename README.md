Yii Sftp Component
====

Yii component to work with sftp connections.

This is a fork of http://www.yiiframework.com/extension/sftp/ with some bugs fixed and some new methods.

New methods:

readFile($remoteFile) - reads and returns remote file contents.

writeFile($remoteFile, $data) - puts $data into remote file.
